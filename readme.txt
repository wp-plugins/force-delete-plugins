Changes the default behavior of the bulk delete plugin actions so it deletes plugins regardless whether they are active or not.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin and get it working:

1. Upload plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Select plugins in the plugin table that you want to delete just like you would do normally.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does this plugin exist?
I was annoyed by the default behavior of WordPress and wanted to fix it. It's also an excuse to publish a WP plugin in the .org Repo.
